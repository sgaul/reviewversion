## Low population growth

Low population growth overall; losing population in center city, slow outside, most rapid in outer suburbs. Not great at attracting people to the region.

--- 
## Suburbanization of poverty

New poverty will occur in suburbs, new challenges towns can't ignore.

---
## Aging population

Suburbs are aging quickly and not good prospects for replacing with younger generation, based on current projections.

--- 
## School enrollment declining

Aging population reflected in overall declining school enrollment. Local schools hit twice - once with demographics, again through increase in magnet / private enrollment.

--- 
## Linguistic diversity

Diversity part of changing population (tie back to 1st chart); which suburbs will 'globalize'? Where will new population in our region come from? (Add refugee factoid.)

--- 
## Everyone commutes, mostly to Hartford

Globally connected city via employers as well. Draws high-skill jobs to the region, so people commute to the job centers (Hartford and some other towns).

--- 
## Meeting demands for a skilled workforce

Commuting and the next 2 slides together, making the case that region has high skilled jobs as an asset, but skills not equitably distributed in the workforce.

--- 
## Job growth

And job growth in historically strong sectors (finance & insurance, manufacturing) has not been strong recently. Changes in job market - strengths are strengths no longer. 

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-7](assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-7.png) 


--- 
## Youth unemployment highest

Possibly lose this one, somewhat redundant with other figures. 

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-8](assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-8.png) 


--- 
## Talent pipeline from schools

Where is future workforce? Don't know what future jobs will be, but best strategy is to have an educated population. High skills jobs (college+) will be most in demand.

--- 
## Achievement gap starts early

And can start addressing gaps in education early on, including even earlier in early childhood. 

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-10](assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-10.png) 


--- 
## Chronic absenteeism an early warning sign

Possibly drop, add in grade-level breakout - where are kids chronically absent in K - 3, middle school. 

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-11](assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-11.png) 


--- 
## Where would you like to live?

Creating opportunity in the region, what makes 'vibrant communities'? Knit together four slides with maps of region for homeownership, crime, affordable housing and voting. 

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-12](assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-12.png) 


--- 
## Affordable housing

Part of creating opportunity outside areas of concentrated poverty. 

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-13](assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-13.png) 


--- 
## Hartford getting safer.

Choice in housing based on factors like schools and safety. Doing better but still understandable that those who can afford to live in low-crime towns. Swith to regional map.

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-14](assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-14.png) 


--- 
## Voter turnout another measure of civic health

With with housing, crime. Add in factoid about diversity of gov't officials representing electorate (Hartford / region are among the worst nationally).
