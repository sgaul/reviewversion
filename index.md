## Defining the region: Hartford + surrounding towns

CRCOG region. Based on characteristics of each town, using UConn categories from [5 CTs report](http://ctsdc.uconn.edu/projections/5cts.html), with slight updates.

## Low population growth

Low population growth overall; losing population in center city, slow growth outside, most rapid in outer suburbs. Region struggles to attract new residents.

--- 
## Suburbanization of poverty

New poverty occurring in suburbs, new challenges towns can't ignore.

---
## Aging population

Suburbs are aging quickly with no good prospects for replacing with younger generation, based on current projections.

--- 
## School enrollment declining

Aging population reflected in overall decline in school enrollment. Local schools impacted by demographics and through increase in magnet / private enrollment. Leading to large number of neighborhood school closures/consolidations.

--- 
## Linguistic diversity

More diversity in changing population (tie back to 1st chart); which suburbs will 'globalize'? Where will new population in our region come from and what impact will this have?

--- 
## Everyone commutes, mostly to Hartford

Large segments of regions workers commute to Hartford and some other communities with high concentration of high-skill jobs. Typical of capital cities.

## Demand for a skilled workforce

Region continues to have highly skilled workforce, but skills are not equitably distributed among all resident populations.

--- 
## Job growth

While still providing many jobs, historically strong sectors (finance & insurance, manufacturing) have seen declines recently. Sectors with opportunities for growth involve service industries related to serving the needs of an aging, poorer population.

## Talent pipeline from schools

Where is future workforce? Don't know what future jobs will be, but best strategy is to have an educated population. High skills jobs (college+) will be most in demand. As in the workforce pipeline, academic achievement gaps exist among various resident populations.

--- 
## Achievement gap starts early

As third grade reading scores indicate, there is an urgent need to addressing gaps in education early on, including even earlier in early childhood.  Gaps between ELL and special education students are most significant.

## What makes a vibrant community?

Significant gap in the number homeowners Hartford versus neighboring communities in the region. Lack of affordable housing outside of Hartford leads to high levels of concentrated poverty in the city. Affordable housing options in suburban communities must be increased. Crime in Hartford has declined but neighboring communities still enjoy higher levels of public safety. Residents who can afford to live in low-crime areas outside the city will do so. Lack of engagement in the electoral process makes it difficult for city residents to make changes in their community.
