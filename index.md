## Defining the region: Hartford + surrounding towns

CRCOG region. Based on characteristics of each town, using categories from [5 Connecticuts report](http://ctsdc.uconn.edu/projections/5cts.html).

## Low population growth

Low population growth overall and suburbanization rather than urbanization. Most live in the urban periphery now - but growth has flattened and poverty has doubled in these towns since the 1970s. Most growth  projected in affluent outer suburbs

--- 
## Suburbanization of poverty

New poverty occurring in suburbs leading to new challenges towns can't ignore. Hartford poverty rate at 38 percent now, among highest nationally.

## Aging population

Suburbs are aging quickly with no projected decline in next generation population.

--- 
## School enrollment declining

Aging population reflected in overall decline in school enrollment. Local schools impacted by demographics and through increase in magnet / private enrollment. Leading to large number of neighborhood school closures/consolidations.

## Linguistic diversity

More diversity in changing population - seen through lens of school languages; which suburbs have or will 'globalize'? Where will new population in our region come from and what impact will this have?

## Everyone commutes, mostly to Hartford

More than 106,000 jobs bring commuters into Hartford for work every day, mostly high-skills jobs. At the same time, twice as many Hartford residents work in the suburbs as work in the city, often low-skills jobs. Spatial mismatch more extreme than many similar cities.

## Demand for a skilled workforce

Region continues to have highly skilled workforce, but skills are not equitably distributed among all resident populations.

--- 
## Job growth

While still providing many jobs, historically strong sectors (finance & insurance, manufacturing) have seen declines recently. Sectors with opportunities for growth involve service industries related to serving the needs of an aging, poorer population.

## Talent pipeline from schools

Where is future workforce? Don't know what jobs future will hold, but best strategy is to have an educated population. High skills jobs (college+) will be most in demand. As in the workforce pipeline, academic achievement gaps exist among various resident populations.

--- 
## Achievement gap starts early

Scores improving for all subgroups, but gaps not narrowing over time. An urgent need to address gaps in education early on, including in early childhood.  Gaps between ELL and special education students are most significant.

## What makes a vibrant community?

Significant gap in the number homeowners Hartford versus neighboring communities in the region. Lack of affordable housing outside of Hartford leads to high levels of concentrated poverty in the city. Affordable housing options in suburban communities must be increased. Crime in Hartford has declined but neighboring communities still enjoy higher levels of public safety. Residents who can afford to live in low-crime areas outside the city will do so. Lack of engagement in the electoral process makes it difficult for city residents to make changes in their community.
